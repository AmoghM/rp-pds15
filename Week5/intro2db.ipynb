      "The Apache Derby project is aimed at building an open source database written entirely in the Java programming language that's easy to use but suitable for a majority of applications. As you can imagine, developing a database isn't simple, and the Apache Derby database is no exception (because it's open source software, you can look for yourself). But the Derby project didn't start from scratch. Back in 1996, a new company called Cloudscape, Inc. was founded with the goal of building a database server written in the Java language. The company's first release came a year later, and eventually the product's name was changed to Cloudscape. In 1999, Cloudscape, Inc. was purchased by Informix Software, Inc., a large database vendor. Informix Software was purchased by IBM in 2001, and the IBM Cloudscape\u2122 database system was used as an embedded database engine in a number of IBM's products. In April 2004, IBM donated the Cloudscape database software to the Apache Software Foundation, and the Apache Derby project was born.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time, the Cloudscape database was approximately half a million lines of Java code, which took some time to properly convert to the Apache Derby project. After an incubation period, Derby was officially released in July 2005. So while it may seem like the new kid on the block, Derby comes with nearly ten years of development behind it.\n",
      "IBM continues to manage the Cloudscape database, which is built from the Apache Derby source code. IBM offers the Cloudscape database as a free download, and also offers fee-based consulting services for clients who want added peace of mind. In addition, Sun Microsystems has announced that it will include a patched version of Apache Derby as its Java DB product. This strong commitment from IBM and Sun emphasizes the bright future of the Apache Derby database. The Derby database also conforms to a number of database standards, such as SQL-92 and JDBC, Version 3.0; thus an application that is initially developed using the Derby database system can be easily ported to another database system, such as IBM DB2 Universal Database\u2122.\n",

      "### Downloading Apache Derby\n",
      "To appreciate the simplicity of working with Apache Derby, the best technique is to jump in and try it. The rest of this section provides general instructions for downloading and verifying your version of Apache Derby (see Resources for a link to the official Apache Derby Web site for instructions specific to your operating system). These instructions assume you have a suitable Java Runtime Environment (JRE) successfully installed. Any JRE version higher than 1.3 should be sufficient, but this article series uses Java 1.4.2 or higher.\n",
      "With those prerequisites out of the way, the first step is to download Apache Derby. As shown in Figure 3, you can download three different versions: source, library, and binary. The source version is just that: the source code. To use this version, you must compile the source code and build your own .jar file. The library version includes only the necessary .jar file for the Derby database. The binary version includes the .jar file and the Derby documentation.\n",
      "For simplicity's sake, download the binary version. Be sure to verify the integrity of your download; this includes verifying the PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) signature, which guarantees that you downloaded the official version, and verifying the MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5) signature, which guarantees that your download files weren't corrupted.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Installing Apache Derby\n",
      "\n",
      "After you've successfully downloaded and verified the integrity of the archive containing the Derby database files, the installation is simple (although mildly platform dependent):\n",
      "Choose a suitable location, such as C:\\Apache on a Windows system or /opt/Apache on a UNIX-based system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Open a terminal window (or a command prompt on Windows), change to this new directory, and expand the archive containing the Derby database. Doing so creates a new directory named with the version of the Derby database you installed, for example, db-derby-10.1.2.1-bin.\n",
      "Add the Derby .jar file to your CLASSPATH environment variable. If you're comfortable working at the command prompt, you can do this directly by adding derby.jar, which is located in the db-derby-10.1.2.1-bin/lib subdirectory, to the CLASSPATH variable. Alternatively, you can run the setEmbeddedCP script provided in the db-derby-10.1.2.1-bin\\frameworks\\embedded\\bin subdirectory. Before running this script, you should either set the DERBY_INSTALL environment variable or modify the script so that DERBY_INSTALL points to the directory in which you installed the Derby database.\n",
      "Verify your installation by using the sysinfo tool, as shown in Listing 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, you have a working database system, which you can run either as a stand-alone network server or as an embedded database within your own application. Future column installments will show you how to run Derby in both models and provide additional database insights.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Using Apache Derby\n",
      "\n",
      "Working with a database system doesn't have to be difficult. By using Apache Derby, you can quickly begin working with a full-featured database system. And because Apache Derby is a standards-compliant database, applications developed using it can be easily migrated to a more powerful database system as the situation warrants."

Fortunately, Apache Derby is a lightweight database, and you won't need to devote your life to becoming proficient. You'll be able to start working with it after following the steps in this article.\n",
      "\n",

      "### The ACID test\n",
      "\n",
      "Diamonds are obviously a valuable commodity -- so valuable that counterfeits are a serious concern. One simple and (at least, in the movies) popular test to determine whether a diamond is real is to run it across a piece of glass. Because diamonds are one of the hardest materials known, a real diamond easily cuts the glass surface; a fake, especially if it's made of glass itself, won't.\n",
      "To a software developer, databases are equally valuable. If you use a database, you want to be sure it will safely store your data and let you easily retrieve the data later. You also want your database to allow multiple programs (or people) to work with the database without interfering with each other. To demonstrate, imagine you own a bank. The database for your bank must do the following, among other things:\n",
      "- Safely store the appropriate data\n",
      "- Quickly retrieve the appropriate data\n",
      "- Support multiple, concurrent user sessions\n",
      "\n",
      "These tasks can be collectively referred to as the ACID test; ACID is an acronym for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Atomicity means that operations with the database can be grouped together and treated as a single unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consistency guarantees that either all the operations in this single unit (or transaction) are performed successfully, or none of them is performed. In other words, a database can't be in an unfinished state. To understand why these characteristics are important, think about a bank transaction during which money is transferred from a savings account into a checking account. If the transfer process fails after subtracting the money from your savings account and before it was added to your checking account, you would become poorer, and the bank would have an angry (ex)customer! Atomicity enables the two operations -- the subtraction from the savings account and the addition to the checking account -- to be treated as a single transaction. Consistency guarantees that both operations in the transaction either succeed or fail. That way, your money isn't lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isolation means that independent sets of database transactions are performed in such a way that they don't conflict with each other. Continuing the bank analogy, consider two customers who transfer funds between accounts at the same time. The database must track both transfers separately; otherwise, the funds could go into the wrong accounts, and the bank might be left with two angry (ex)customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Durability guarantees that the database is safe against unexpected terminations. It may be a minor inconvenience if your television or computer won't work when the power goes out, but the same can't be said for a database. If the bank's computers lose power when transferring your funds, you won't be a happy customer if the transaction is lost. Durability guarantees that if the database terminates abnormally during a funds transfer, then when the database is brought back up, it will be able to recover the transaction and continue with normal operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Passing the ACID test is nontrivial, and many simple databases fall short. For critical e-business or Web-based applications, passing the ACID test is a must. This is one of the reasons so many companies and individuals utilize enterprise-level database systems, such as IBM DB2\u00ae Universal Database, Oracle 10g, or Microsoft\u00ae SQL Server. These databases are fully compliant with the ACID test. Compared to these database systems, the Apache Derby database may seem like the forgotten stepchild. However, Apache Derby is fully compliant with the ACID test, and you can use it with confidence to develop Web-based database applications. In addition, if you begin using Apache Derby, and your application (or business) grows, you can migrate your database application to an enterprise-class database system like DB2 with minimal difficulty."
