You will learn how to access the course material later in this lesson.\n\n-----\n\n### Policies\n\n#### Respect\n\nIn this course, I expect you to be professional with the instructor, your fellow classmates, and the research park staff. \n\n#### Interactive\n\nI also expect this course to be interactive, you will learn best by doing. Thus, I will introduce concepts, techniques, or tools, and you will try them out in a breakout session. Thus it is important to complete any technology requirements ahead of time to the extent possible.\n\n#### Assignments\n\nTo reinforce material, you will be givn short assignments to work on during breakoput sessions. You can work on this individually, or in pairs. You also can work on assignments after class, and use the Piazza to communicate with the rest of the class. Later in this lesson you will have a time to find prospective partners.\n\n#### Communication\n\nI will use the course Piazza to communicate with the full class outside of our normal meeting times. You also can post questions about the course content or about data science in general, and you should also feel free to add your answer or point of view to existing questions on the Piazza from other students.\n\n----"

You also should visit\nthe course Piazza.\n\n### Week 1: Data Science at the Command Line:  \n \nUse the Docker technology by working at the Unix command prompt within\nthe course Docker container in interactive mode. This will focus on\nusing Unix command line tools and techniques to work with data in the\nBASH shell\n\n### Week 2: Practical IPython:  \n\nLearn how to use the IPython notebook by using the course Docker\ncontainer in server mode. Also learn basic Python programming, python\ndata types, and file I/O, before finishing with a quick overview of the\nnumpy and scipy libraries.\n\n### Week 3: Exploring Data Through Visualizations:  \n \nLearn how to make data visualization by using Python, primarily from\nwithin the IPython notebook by using matplotlib and seaborn. This will\ninclude a discussion of scatter plots, linear regression and plotting,\nhistograms, box plots, and other advanced visualization concepts.\n\n### Week 4: Using Python DataFrames (Pandas):  \n\nLearn about the _Data Frame_ concept and how to use it within Python by\nusing the Pandas library. This will include ways to load and work with\nlarge tabular data, and to performa basic data operations like cleaning,\ntransforming, merging, and reshaping.\n\n### Week 5: Using Databases:  \n\nLearn about database technology, before specifically focusing on\nrelational database management systems. This will include learning how\nto create database, and SQL DDL and DML to create, insert, update and\ndelete data. This will conclude with a discussion of accessing a\ndatabase from Python.\n\n### Week 6: Data Acquisition:  \n\nLearn about acquiring data from diverse sources including webpages,\nonline repositories, and social media. This will require a discussion of\nweb scraping, DOM tress, and JSON.\n\n### Week 7: Statistical & Machine Learning:  \n \nReview basic statistics and probability and learn how to compute\ndifferent random distributions  by using numpy and scipy routines. Next,\nlearn about machine learning and basic approaches to perform machine\nlearning by using the scikit_learn library in Python.\n\n### Week 8: Data Intensive Computing:  \n\nLearn about basic concepts in high performance computing and how to\nperform them in Python. Next, learn about cloud computing, including how\nDocker technology integrates into commercial clouds. Finally, a\ndiscussion of the standard Hadoop platform and its capabilities.\n\n----\n"
