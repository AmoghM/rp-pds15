      "## The Unix Shell\n",
      "\n",
      "A standard [Unix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) system provides a command-line interface to allow a user to interact with the underlying hardware. While this may lack the ease of use most modern graphical operating systems provide, a command line has several benefits:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Flexible and powerful access to teh underlying hardware\n",
      "2. Interactions are identical between local and remote hardware\n",
      "3. Commands can be connected or their input/output redirected.\n",
      "\n",
      "The standard command-line interface on a Unix system is providd by a tool called a shell. While several different shells xist, one of the more popular is the [Bash shell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)), which is what we will use by default in this course.\n",
      "\n",
      "A shell allows a user to run (multiple) programs, to redirect the input and output from programs, and to connect programs together by using pipes. They also allow a user to move around the filesystem, and to automate basic processing by writing small programs known as shell scripts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Commands are entered at the shell prompt. In this course, we have two shell prompts:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The Host operating system prompt `$`, which is provided by the Boot2Docker application on Mac OSX or Windows.\n",
      "2. The Docker container system prompt `/notebooks #`.\n",

      "## The Unix Process Model\n",
      "\n",
      "Unix operating systems support running multiple processes at the same time. In fact a central tenet of Unix is that the sum is greater than the individual parts, or the combination of multiple running parts gives greater strength. Even if a user has no running processes, the system itself will have a number of processes running. A process is identified by a process identifier, or `pid`. \n",
      "\n",
      "Several Unix commands are avialable for working directly with processes:\n",
      "\n",
      "### `ps`\n",
      "used to find out the processes that are current;y running. By default ps only list the user's processes, although flags can be used to list system processes or processes being run by other users (on a multi-user system).\n",
      "\n",
      "    ps\n",
      " \n",
      "### `top`\n",
      "used to continually monitor running processes to see how they are consuming resources (e.g., memory or cpu). To exit from a running `top` display, enter the `q` key.\n",
      "\n",
      "    top\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### `kill`\n",
      "used to send a signal, including the terminate signal to a running process. To send a signal to a specific process you must have the correct pid (and have sufficient permission to send the signal). For example, to send the terminate signal to a running process with `pid` of 323:\n",
      "\n",
      "    kill -9 323\n",
      "\n",
      "### Standard Streams\n",
      "By default Unix processes read input from a standard input stream, known as `stdin`, write their output to a standard output stream, known as `stdout`, and report any error conditions to a standard error stream, kmown as `stderr`. By default, `stdin` is the keyboard, while `stdout` and `stderr` are the display. However, these can be changed as needed at the Unix command line.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Unix process model allows commands to be connected by employing a [Unix pipe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)) to connect the `stdout` of one command to the `stdin` of a second command. This process can continue, allowing multiple processes to be chained together into a pipeline. This concept will make more sense later when we have covered more Unix commands, but the basic syntax is to use the pipe character `|` to connect commands together into a pipeline.\n",

      "\n",
      "The [Unix filesystem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem) provides for data storage and retreival from the underlying hardware, as well as interprocess communication through pipes. The Unix filesystem is based on a single rooted tree model. The root of the tree is known as the __root__ directory, and is denoted by the `/` chracter. Sub-directories branch off from this root directory to form the entire filesystem heirarchy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Files and directories have owners and groups (for example I am the owner of this lesson, but the entire class would have grouop access). A special owner is known as root, or the superuser. If you have sufficient privileges, you can switch to the superuser by using the `sudo` command. Each entry in the file system has a permission mask that specifies what the owner, the group, and the entire world (or all) can do to the particular item.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, on our docker container we have the following root directory:\n",

There are three typoes of permissions: read, write, and execute, and they are listed in that order. If a permission is not granted it is indicated by a `-` characater in the relevant position. So `-rwxr-xr-x` means the entry is a file that can be read, written, and executed by the user, but only read and executed by the group to which the file belongs or the anyone who can access file. Unix file permissions can be confusing, but with practice will begin to sense.\n",
      "\n",

Each of these commands can take `-R` as a flag to indicate that the operation should be performed recursively if the item is a directory. This will change every sub-directory or file contained within that directory or sub-directory.\n",

This was discussed before in the context of process pipes; however, we can also redirect the standard streams to be files. Fopr example, we can change `stdin` to be a file so that a command reads its input from the file, or change `stdout` and/or `stderr` so that the output of a program is written to a file.
