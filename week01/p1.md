## Week 1 Assignment

### Problem 1

- First, follow the steps in the [Docker installation guides] from the
orientation week.

- Run a container with your data volume attached:

```console
$ docker run -it --volumes-from my-data lcdm/info490 /bin/bash
```

In the docker container, create a text file with your name:

```console
root@4b13abb47ef9:/# echo 'FirstName LastName' > /data/<firstname>-<lastname>-hostname.txt
root@4b13abb47ef9:/# hostname >> /data/<firstname>-<lastname>-hostname.txt
```

This will create a text file with your name and the server name in `/data` folder. You should of course replace your name in the above commands. You might check
if your file looks correct:

```console
root@4b13abb47ef9:/# cat /data/<firstname>-<lastname>-hostname.txt
```

With folder sharing working, you will be able to access this file from the host
machine.

- Rename your file to `<firstname>-<lastname>-hostname.txt` and upload it to Moodle.
